# Dan Manners' Tekton Tasks

The structure of this project is loosely based on the [official Tekton CI/CD Catalog repository](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog).

## Project Structure

1. Each resource follows the following structure:

```
/task                                       ðŸ‘ˆ the kind of the resource

    /buildah-build                          ðŸ‘ˆ definition file must have same name

        /readme.md                          ðŸ‘ˆ owners of this tasks and changelog

        /0.1
            /readme.md                      ðŸ‘ˆ instructions on how to use the task

            /buildah-build.yaml             ðŸ‘ˆ should match task name; installs Task (single namespace)

            /kustomization.yaml             ðŸ‘ˆ install the resource as a ClusterTask (all namespaces)

        /0.2/
            ...
```

1. Resource YAML file includes following changes
  *  Labels include the version of the resource.
  *  Annotations include `minimum pipeline version` supported by the resource,
     `tags` associated with the resource and `displayName` of the resource

```yaml
labels:
    tekton.dev/version: "0.1"                         ðŸ‘ˆ Version of the resource

annotations:
    tekton.dev/pipelines.minVersion: "0.12.1"         ðŸ‘ˆ minVersion of pipeline resource is compatible
    tekton.dev/categories: CLI                        ðŸ‘ˆ comma separated list of categories
    tekton.dev/displayName: "Ansible Tower Cli"       ðŸ‘ˆ displayName can be optional
    tekton.dev/platforms: "linux/amd64,linux/s390x"   ðŸ‘ˆ comma separated list of platforms, can be optional

## List of Categories

The list of categories I am using are based on [the official Tekton CI/CD catalog list, which can be found here](https://github.com/tektoncd/hub/blob/b36255f9a512b9f4cccb4fd566a45da4d878810a/config.yaml#L15). While similar, they do not match at this time.

```yaml
categories:
  - name: Automation
  - name: Build Tools
  - name: CLI
  - name: Code Quality
  - name: Containerization
  - name: Continuous Integration
